TensorFlow Model Deployment
This repository contains a trained neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is saved in the HDF5 format and is ready for deployment or further development.
Project Description
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to train, save, and load a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. This can be used for classification, regression, or other predictive tasks depending on the training dataset.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
Installation
pip install tensorflow numpy
Loading the Model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the saved model
model = load_model('8599c502-52d4-4966-a84d-048b32699b4c.h5')

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
 Usage
You can use the model for prediction as follows:

# Assuming you have preprocessed input data named `X`
predictions = model.predict(X)
 Notes
- Make sure input data is scaled/formatted the same way as the training data.
- For inference performance optimization, consider converting the model to TensorFlow Lite or SavedModel format.
